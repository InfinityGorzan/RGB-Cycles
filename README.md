# RGB Cycles

This library is used especially if you want to go through RGB colors.

The order of colors is this: 

- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Light Blue
- Dark Blue
- Purple
- Pink
- Back to Red.

Since this project uses the MIT License, you can replace 0.03124999936 with a higher or lower number to increase the speed. We recommend to just multiply this by 2 till you get the speed you want.

## How to use

Use the cycleColors() function from this library in a while loop. cycleColors() returns 
(red, green, blue) in a tuple so you can use tuple unpacking.
